beforetoc: The Small Multiple Line Chart was my first foray into developing custom visuals for Power BI. It represented a huge amount of learning and personal development, so I was really happy to release it to the Marketplace and I've had some pretty awesome feedback from many users around the world. <p>There were a number of great suggestions for improvement, and quite a few issues that needed attention. When I sat down to review how I can make these changes, I realised I perhaps needed to re-architect the visual to support them. A couple of months back, I bit the bullet, and decided I was going to get them done. This release represents a huge amount of rework and utilises many more features of the custom visuals SDK, and should provide users with much more functionality and stability. <p> Here's a run-down of the changes to expect in this release.

## Availability

The visual is currently undergoing testing with the custom visuals team, and while the listing has been updated to show version **2.0.0**, the visual takes a little longer to come through and for the moment, version **1.0.1** will continue to show in your reports. I'll update this article when everything is fully live. 

If you are using this through the [organization custom visuals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/power-bi-custom-visuals-organization) mechanism, you can download the 2.0.0 version of the visual from the [repository's Releases page](https://github.com/dm-p/powerbi-visuals-smlc/releases) in the meantime.

The visual [continues to remain open source](https://github.com/dm-p/powerbi-visuals-smlc), for anyone who wishes to contribute or use the code to learn how to write their own custom visuals.

## Specific Property Menus

The v1 visual had a single menu for managing aspects of configuring small multiples, but this resulted in some complex management of property states internally. This menu has been split into three separate ones:

* **SM Layout** - configuration of the small multiple 'grid', including behaviour.
* **SM Heading** - configuration of the small multiple heading (formerly known as *Label*).
* **SM Styling** - configuration of the small multiple background and border styling.

Each menu's functionality is explained in its own section below.

### SM Layout Menu

The behaviour of the grid is specified by using **Column Sizing** and **Row Sizing**, and their associated properties. You can use specific combinations of these properties to better control how your small multiple 'grid' is laid out.

Specifying a **Multiple Height** or **Multiple Width** allows you to guarantee the sizing of the particular dimension of your small multiples, if you are unsure as to how many will be displayed in the visual at one time (for example, if your report contains interactions and users may be doing their own filtering).

#### Column Sizing

**Column Sizing** has two settings:

* **Fixed Width** (default) - specify a width for each small multiple, in pixels. The visual will 'flow' small multiples onto the next row to ensure that widths are preserved, e.g.:
<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/flow_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Example of fixed <b>Multiple Width</b>, with fixed <b>Multiple Height</b>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

* **Fixed # Columns** - specify a number of columns to fit in each row. This will divide the width evenly for each row and is the way the v1 visual would calculate widths for each small multiple, e.g.:
<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/even_width_height_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Example of specifying <b>Fixed # Columns</b> (3), with <b>Divide Evenly</b> for height.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

#### Row Sizing

**Row Sizing** has 2 settings:

* **Fixed Height** (default) - specify a height for each small multiple, in pixels. If the visual height is too small to display all small multiples vertically, then the visual will scroll to accomodate them.
* **Divide Evenly** - divide the row height evenly, over the height of the visual. This is the v1 behaviour of the visual, in conjunction with **Fixed # Columns** above.

### SM Heading Menu

This menu contains all options that used to be responsible for controlling the heading (formerly known as *Label*). With the exception of some fixing of issues around handling text at higher font sizes, this is largely unchanged and simply represents a logical grouping of the properties.

### SM Styling Menu

This property menu is responsible for handling the styling of small multiple backgrounds and borders, and similar to the **SM Heading** menu, is largely unchanged, with the exception of improving the cosmetic behaviour of small multiple borders to look more consistent (some edges were uneven in v1) and some minor changes to the **Zebra Stripe** properties - now renamed to **Alternate Background Color**.

#### Alternate Background Color

A **Color By** property has been added, which allows the following options:

* **Column** - the color is applied to each alternate column within each row. This is how *Zebra Stripe* was applied in v1.
<br>![Simple example of SM Alternate Background by column](/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/sm_background_alternate_column.png)
* **Row** - the color is applied to every small multiple in each alternate row.
<br>![Simple example of SM Alternate Background by row](/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/sm_background_alternate_row.png)
* **Small Multiple** - the color is applied to each alternate small multiple, across the whole visual. If you have an even number of small multiples in a row, this can look very similar to **Column**.

## Line Styling

In version 1, the only option for lines was to change the colour. The options have been expanded quite significantly for version 2. All properties can be found in the **Line Styling** property menu, and a new section will be displayed for each measure you add to your visual.

> **Please note** that measures in the Line Styling menu are separated with hyphens (`----------`). This is because containers (where measures are selectable via dropdown) are not yet fully supported for non-Microsoft visuals. This is expected to be available "sometime in 2020" and as soon as it's available, it's definitely going into this one.

### Stroke Width

You can use **Stroke Width** to tailor each measure's thickness, e.g.:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/stroke_width_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Specifying a different <b>Stroke Width</b> for a measure.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

You can set this to **0** to hide the line if you just wish to use **Show Area** for your measure. Speaking of which...

### Show Area & Transparency

A measure can be set to behave as an area rather than a line, by setting **Show Area** to *On*. Once this is enabled, an additional **Transparency** property is available, e.g.:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/area_and_transparency_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Working with <b>Show Area</b> and <b>Transparency</b> for a measure.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

### Shape

The **Shape** property allows you to specify how the data points are interpolated, e.g.:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/shape_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Modifying data point interpolation with the <b>Shape</b> property.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

### Style

The **Style** property provides different line styling for each measure, e.g.:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/line_style_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Modifying how the line appears with the <b>Style</b> property.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

An additional curve type of **Cardinal** is also available, should your data not work well with the **Natural** curve type (in most cases, **Natural** should work fine).

## Improved Tooltip Functionality

Since the visual was initially released, support for canvas (report page) tooltips has been made available. This has been added into the visual, e.g.:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/canvas_tooltip_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Example of a report page (canvas) tooltip, with additional small multiples.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

The **Tooltip** menu, which enables the user to configure the standard tooltip more fully, has also been made available in the visual.

Version 1 had some minor issues with tracking data points with the mouse, and this has also been improved.

## Context Menu, Drillthrough & Drilldown

Context menu support is also a recent addition to the custom visuals SDK, so the visual has been enabled with it. If you've set up a suitable drillthrough page that will contain eligible fields or measures then drillthrough becomes available, e.g.:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/drillthrough_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Example of drillthrough to an appropriate page.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

The **Small Mutliple** field has been enabled for drilldown, if using suitable attributes or a hierarchy, meaning that this is also possible via the context menu, e.g.:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/drilldown_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Example of drilling-down from country to city and back up.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

## Categorical X-Axis Support

Probably the most requested (and most overlooked) feature from the original release, is the ability to include a categorical field on the X-axis. The x-axis now supports linear, categorical and date/time fields:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/x-axis_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Example using different data types on the X-axis.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

> **Please note** that with categorical fields, it's assumed that these are intended to be used in an ordinal (ordered) manner. Line charts aren't a good visualisation choice for nominal categories.

## Sorting

Standard sorting is now available from the ellipsis (`...`) in the visual header, and you are now able to sort using any field that ois present in the visual's data roles, e.g.:

<div class="text-center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/smlc/2.0.0/sorting_example.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Example sorting by a field and then by our measure.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

## Increased Data Limits

As part of the re-write, I've been able to improve the performance of the visual, so the data limits have been upped from **50** small multiple values and **200** axis values (10K total) to **100** small multiple values and **300** axis values (30K total).

## What's Next?

Now that the visual has been re-written, the code-base is much more accomodating for additional features, so I'm hoping to keep the momentum up after a long hiatus on this one. 

I'll initially be focusing my efforts on finally getting the visual certified but would love to hear from anyone who has ideas for improving it further. Please feel free to [log any requests or potential issues](https://github.com/dm-p/powerbi-visuals-smlc/issues) in the visual's GitHub repository.

Thanks very much to everyone for their continued feedback and great ideas, and I hope that you find the new changes valuable additions for visualising your data stories!

Until next time,

DM-P
